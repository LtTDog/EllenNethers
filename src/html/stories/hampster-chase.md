Grandma used to watch me and my brother when we were kids. I use to have this little chubby hamster that would just sit in my shirt pocket. We got the idea one day to scare Grandma with the hampster.  I walked up to her with it in my pocket and then showed her. She freaked out and took off running, which was all the more funny so I chased her around the house and upstairs to the bathroom.  She pulled the bathroom door close to keep me out and pulled off the knob.  

Then a whole new fear for poor granny because she was claustrophobia.  Now she was trapped in the bathroom, she was yelling at us to open the door which we couldn't because she had the knob that would open the door.  So we tried to explain that she had to put it in the door to open it.  Instead of just putting it in the door grandma in a panic kept slamming it into the wood of the door insisting it wouldn't fit.  This went on for about 5 mins in which we were laughing so hard we couldn't breath and she was an a panic.  Eventually she did calm down enough to open the door, even though we totured her she didn't punish us.

I miss you so much granny.
